List up available windows and filter them with [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf). Bring the selected window to the foreground.

## Troubleshooting

Bringing a window to the foreground may fail due to limitations on **Windows**. Sending a `Win-Shift-M` (restore all minimized windows) and `U-Alt` (Alt key Up) key input beforehand may reduce the chances of failure.
